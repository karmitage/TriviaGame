# TriviaGame

This game displays trivia questions, giving the user 30 seconds to respond to each question. If the user doesn't respond, the next question is displayed. At the end of the game, the user's results are displayed and they are given the option to play again.

I struggled a lot with this assignment & ultimately did not get it completely working. There's no  countdown timer for each question, and I don't have any css styling.
